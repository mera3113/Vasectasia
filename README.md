Summary: To investigate the functional role of EGFR in the formation of large vessels, we established a mesenchymal glioma stem cell line (83) with intact EGFR and knocked down EGFR by Crispr-Cas9.

Design: 	Comparative single cells gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for 83 wild type EGFR and its EGFR knockdown derivative (83 WT vs. 83 KO).

Data availability: GSE207360
